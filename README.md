# NeoFPS_UnofficialExtensions
This is a set of scripts that we've written for my games using NeoFPS. Feel free to use them. We'd love for you to contribute tot hem too. 

Code here is built for specific purposes and it works for that purpose. We encourage reuse but we don't offer any kind of guarantee that it will work in your use case. 
If you can improve the code we will gladly accept a patch. If you are having problems using it raise an issue and maybe we'll be able to help, but no promises.

We've added a blood loss system to the Neo FPS Emerald AI integration, you can see how it works in our [Weekend Hack: FPS Hunter Game](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I27gpQKw_jM&t=81).
